The Adventures of Leo the Little Lion

Once upon a time, in a big green jungle, there lived a little lion named Leo. Leo loved to explore the jungle and make new friends. One sunny day, Leo found a shiny red ball near a tall tree. He was so excited!

Leo decided to play with the ball, but it rolled away into a big bush. When Leo tried to find it, he met a friendly rabbit named Ruby. Ruby said, "I saw your ball! It rolled down the hill."

Leo and Ruby ran down the hill together. At the bottom, they found the ball near a sparkling blue river. They laughed and played catch until the sun began to set.

As the sky turned orange and pink, Ruby said, "Let’s meet here tomorrow and play again!" Leo smiled and said, "I’d love that!"

And so, Leo and Ruby became best friends, playing together every day.
